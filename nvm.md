# NVM

I use [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) locally to switch between versions of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

This will list all versions:

```bash
nvm list
```

This will switch to the newest version:

```bash
nvm use newest
```

This will switch to a specific version:

```bash
nvm use 14.15.5
```
