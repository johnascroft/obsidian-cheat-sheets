# df

Stands for disk free, and displays the amount of disk space.

```bash
df
```

A common addition to this command is to append the `-h` option, which is short for `--human-readable`.

```bash
df -h
```

To get disk space available on a specific mount, you can include the mount point.

```bash
df -h /mnt
```
